**Paper Research Questions Review**

This file takes the paper itself, a_summary.md and 2_filled.md (for research questions) to conduct an analysis driven by the user's research questions.

Where a_summary.md ascertains the nature of the paper and does not use 1_scope.md or 2_filled.md in any way, thus is more broad and blue-sky-thinking in the information it obtains from the paper. And where b_scope.md takes the paper itself, a_summary.md and 1_scope.md (for scope points) to conduct an analysis driven by the user's scope points.
