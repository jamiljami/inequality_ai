**Paper Scope Review**

This file takes the paper itself, a_summary.md and 1_scope.md (for scope points) to conduct an analysis driven by the user's scope points. 

Where a_summary.md ascertains the nature of the paper and does not use 1_scope.md or 2_filled.md in any way, thus is more broad and blue-sky-thinking in the information it obtains from the paper. And where c_questions.md takes the paper itself, a_summary.md and 2_filled.md (for research questions) to conduct an analysis driven by the user's research questions.

## "The Future of Employment: How Susceptible Are Jobs to Computerisation?" (Frey & Osborne, 2013)
- Source: Oxford Martin School
- Focus: Job automation vulnerability analysis across 702 occupations
- [findings]: 47% of US jobs are at high risk of automation; Used machine learning (Gaussian Process classifier) to analyze 702 occupations; Found strong negative correlation between wages/education and automation risk 
- [conclusion]: The paper's findings suggest that low-skill workers will need to acquire creative and social skills to remain competitive, which will exacerbate inequality and automation effects.

### [4_experiments/]: Uses task-based analysis methodology to evaluate automation potential across occupations
- Methodology innovation: First quantitative study of future automation potential using machine learning approach
- Technical approach: Used ONET data (9 variables) to train a Gaussian Process classifier on 70 hand-labeled occupations, then predicted automation probability for all 702 occupations
- Engineering bottlenecks: Identified specific technical barriers to automation through task-based analysis
- Task restructuring: Showed how tasks can be simplified to enable automation (e.g., prefabrication in construction)
- Two-Wave Model: First wave targets routine tasks, second wave depends on perception/manipulation breakthroughs
- Business Operation Framework: Analyzes employment, competition, customer, and revenue/cost effects

### [5_conclusions/]: Rapid automation is accelerating beyond manufacturing into services, with 47% of US jobs at risk, requiring major workforce adaptation and likely exacerbating inequality
- Speed of Progress: 47% of US jobs at risk, with rapid growth in service/industrial robots (20% annual growth, 166k units sold in 2011) and Chinese market (>50% growth in 2011)
- Business/Competition Effects: Businesses gain cost reductions and productivity through robot adoption, following a two-wave automation model (routine tasks then perception tasks) enabled by task restructuring
- Employment/Market Effects: Low-skill jobs face highest automation risk, requiring workers to develop creative/social skills while education provides some protection against displacement
- Key Technical Insights: Engineering bottlenecks exist in perception/creativity/social intelligence, while algorithms and robots rapidly expand into information processing, manufacturing, and service domains

# -------------------- IN DETAIL ------------------

### [2_automatable/] What is currently automatable?

#### Current Automation Capabilities

> Digital/Text/Code: "Algorithms for big data are now rapidly entering domains reliant upon storing or accessing information" (p. 37)

> Physical/Manual: "Robots will likely continue to take on an increasing set of manual tasks in manufacturing, packing, construction, maintenance, and agriculture" (p. 807)

> Service Tasks: "Robots are already performing many simple service tasks such as vacuuming, mopping, lawn mowing, and gutter cleaning" (p. 808)

#### Big Players Identified:

> Western: Google (autonomous driverless cars), Amazon (Kiva Systems for warehouse automation), Baxter (low-priced general-purpose robots)

> Global: "Robot sales in China grew by more than 50 percent in 2011" (p. 801), "Globally, industrial robot sales reached a record 166,000 units in 2011" (p. 802)

#### **Frontier/Cusp Technologies:**

> Autonomous Vehicles: "The autonomous driverless cars, developed by Google, provide one example of how manual tasks in transport and logistics may soon be automated" (p. 3)

> Service Robots: "Commercial service robots are now able to perform more complex tasks in food preparation, health care, commercial cleaning, and elderly care" (p. 809)

> General-Purpose Robots: "Low-priced general-purpose models, such as Baxter, are adopted in simple manufacturing and service work" (p. 803)

#### **Engineering Bottlenecks (What's NOT Automatable):**

> Perception and Manipulation: "Robots are still unable to match the depth and breadth of human perception" (p. 24)

> Creative Intelligence: "The principal obstacle to computerising creativity is stating our creative values sufficiently clearly that they can be encoded in a program" (p. 26)

> Social Intelligence: "The real-time recognition of natural human emotion remains a challenging problem" (p. 26)

### [3_effects/] What are the current effects?
#### **Business Competition Effects:**

> Cost Reduction: "As robot costs decline and technological capabilities expand, robots can thus be expected to gradually substitute for labour in a wide range of low-wage service occupations" (p. 810)

> Productivity Gains: "The market for personal and household service robots is growing by about 20 percent annually" (p. 809)

#### **Employment Effects:**

> 47% High Risk: "According to our estimate, 47 percent of total US employment is in the high risk category" (p. 37)

> Wage Polarization: "Wages and educational attainment exhibit a strong negative relationship with the probability of computerisation" (p. 41)

> Historical Shift: "Our model predicts a truncation in the current trend towards labour market polarisation, with computerisation being principally confined to low-skill and low-wage occupations" (p. 44)

#### **Worker Adaptation:**

> Skill Reallocation: "Low-skill workers will reallocate to tasks that are non-susceptible to computerisation â€“ i.e., tasks requiring creative and social intelligence" (p. 44)

> Educational Protection: "High-skill and high-wage occupations are the least susceptible to computer capital" (p. 41)

#### **Social Effects:**

> Unemployment Risk: "Most workers in transportation and logistics occupations, together with the bulk of office and administrative support workers, and labour in production occupations, are at risk" (p. 43)

> Service Sector Vulnerability: "A substantial share of employment in service occupations, where most US job growth has occurred over the past decades, are highly susceptible to computerisation" (p. 44)

### [4_experiments/] What is a thought experiment demonstration of an automated workplace?

#### **Methodology Innovation:**

> First Quantitative Study: "To our knowledge, no study has yet quantified what recent technological progress is likely to mean for the future of employment" (p. 3)

> Machine Learning Approach: "We implement a novel methodology to estimate the probability of computerisation for 702 detailed occupations, using a Gaussian process classifier" (p. 1)

#### **Engineering Bottlenecks Analysis:**

> Perception Challenges: "Tasks that relate to an unstructured work environment can make jobs less susceptible to computerisation" (p. 24)

> Manipulation Limitations: "The handling of irregular objects, for which robots are yet to reach human levels of aptitude" (p. 25)

> Creative Intelligence: "Occupations requiring a high degree of creative intelligence will be automated in the next decades" (p. 26)

#### **Task Restructuring Examples:**

> Construction Prefabrication: "Prefabrication, in which the construction object is partially assembled in a factory before being transported to the construction site, provides a way of largely removing the requirement for adaptability" (p. 23)

> Warehouse Navigation: "Kiva Systems, acquired by Amazon.com in 2012, solved the problem of warehouse navigation by simply placing bar-code stickers on the floor" (p. 25)

#### **Two-Wave Automation Model:**

> First Wave: "Most workers in transportation and logistics occupations, together with the bulk of office and administrative support workers, and labour in production occupations, are likely to be substituted by computer capital" (p. 37)

> Second Wave: "The computerisation of occupations in the medium risk category will mainly depend on perception and manipulation challenges" (p. 39)
