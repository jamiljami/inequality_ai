## 1. Background/Citations/Sources

### Historical Context and Motivation

- [keynes_motivation] Keynes' Technological Unemployment: Paper motivated by Keynes' prediction about labor-saving technology outpacing new job creation

> Keynes prediction: "Our paper is motivated by John Maynard Keynes's frequently cited prediction of widespread technological unemployment 'due to our discovery of means of economising the use of labour outrunning the pace at which we can find new uses for labour'" (p. 1)

> Historical pattern: "The concern over technological unemployment is hardly a recent phenomenon. Throughout history, the process of creative destruction, following technological inventions, has created enormous wealth, but also undesired disruptions." (p. 5)

- [resistance_history] Historical Resistance to Technology: Documents historical resistance to technological change, from guild opposition to Luddite riots

> Worker resistance: "Workers can thus be expected to resist new technologies, insofar that they make their skills obsolete and irreversibly reduce their expected earnings." (p. 6)

> Luddite example: "The 'Luddite' riots between 1811 and 1816 were partly a manifestation of the fear of technological change among workers" (p. 7)

- [industrial_patterns] Industrial Revolution Patterns: Analyzes how 19th century manufacturing was "deskilling" while 20th century computerization created skill complementarity

> Deskilling effect: "An important feature of nineteenth century manufacturing technologies is that they were largely 'deskilling' – i.e. they substituted for skills through the simplification of tasks" (p. 8)

> Skill complementarity: "The idea that technological advances favor more skilled workers is a twentieth century phenomenon." (p. 9)

- [economic_theory] Economic Theory Foundation: Builds on Ricardo's machinery chapter and destruction vs. capitalization effects

> Ricardo's machinery: "The obvious reason why this concern has not materialised relates to Ricardo's famous chapter on machinery, which suggests that labour-saving technology reduces the demand for undifferentiated labour, thus leading to technological unemployment (Ricardo, 1819)." (p. 12)

> Competing effects: "Hence, in short, technological progress has two competing effects on employment (Aghion and Howitt, 1994). First, as technology substitutes for labour, there is a destruction effect, requiring workers to reallocate their labour supply; and second, there is the capitalisation effect, as more companies enter industries where productivity is relatively high, leading employment in those industries to expand." (p. 12)

### Data Sources and Literature Foundation

- [onet_database] O*NET Database: Primary data source providing standardized occupational characteristics

> Database scope: "To implement the above described methodology, we rely on O*NET, an online service developed for the US Department of Labor. The 2010 version of O*NET contains information on 903 detailed occupations" (p. 28)

> Data collection: "The O*NET data was initially collected from labour market analysts, and has since been regularly updated by surveys of each occupation's worker population and related experts" (p. 28)

- [bls_data] BLS Employment Data: Links occupational characteristics to employment and wage statistics

> Data linkage: "The close SOC correspondence of O*NET allows us to link occupational characteristics to 2010 Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) employment and wage data." (p. 28)

- [ml_literature] Machine Learning Literature: Builds on advances in ML, robotics, and AI for technological assessment

> Technological foundation: "Drawing upon recent developments in Engineering Sciences, and in particular advances in the fields of ML, including Data Mining, Machine Vision, Computational Statistics and other sub-fields of Artificial Intelligence, as well as MR, we derive additional dimensions required to understand the susceptibility of jobs to computerisation." (p. 4)

## 2. Research Direction/Questions/Framework/Methodology

### Research Question and Scope

- [primary_question] Primary Research Question: How susceptible are current jobs to computerization?

> Core question: "In this paper, we address the question: how susceptible are jobs to computerisation?" (p. 1)

> Research gap: "To our knowledge, no study has yet quantified what recent technological progress is likely to mean for the future of employment. The present study intends to bridge this gap in the literature." (p. 3)

- [forward_looking] Forward-Looking Approach: Focuses on technological capabilities rather than current implementation

> Engineering perspective: "Rather we aim, from a technological capabilities point of view, to determine which problems engineers need to solve for specific occupations to be automated." (p. 4)

> Capability focus: "We make no attempt to estimate how many jobs will actually be automated. The actual extent and pace of computerisation will depend on several additional factors which were left unaccounted for." (p. 42)

### Theoretical Framework

- [task_model] Task Model Extension: Extends Autor et al. (2003) task model beyond routine tasks

> Model extension: "While the task model predicts that computers for labour substitution will be confined to routine tasks, our model predicts that computerisation can be extended to any non-routine task that is not subject to any engineering bottlenecks to computerisation." (p. 23)

- [bottlenecks] Engineering Bottlenecks Framework: Identifies three key bottlenecks limiting automation

> Bottleneck formula: "According to these findings, non-susceptible labor inputs can be described as, LNS = Σ(LPM,i + LC,i + LSI,i) where LPM, LC and LSI are labour inputs into perception and manipulation tasks, creative intelligence tasks, and social intelligence tasks." (p. 24)

- [big_data_enabler] Big Data as Automation Enabler: Emphasizes how large datasets enable pattern recognition and automation

> Data requirement: "Defining such problems is helped by the provision of relevant data: this is highlighted in the case of handwriting recognition by Plötz and Fink (2009)." (p. 15)

> Pattern recognition: "As a result, computerisation is no longer confined to routine tasks that can be written as rule-based software queries, but is spreading to every non-routine task where big data becomes available (Brynjolfsson and McAfee, 2011)." (p. 16)

### Methodology Development

- [ml_classification] Machine Learning Classification: Uses Gaussian process classifier for probability estimation

> Discriminant function: "We achieve probabilistic classification by introducing a latent function f : x 7→ R, known as a discriminant function." (p. 32)

> Model selection: "We tested three Gaussian process classifiers using the GPML toolbox (Rasmussen and Nickisch, 2010) on our data, built around exponentiated quadratic, rational quadratic and linear covariances." (p. 33)

- [hand_labeling] Hand-Labeling Approach: Combines subjective expert assessment with objective variables

> Expert labeling: "First, together with a group of ML researchers, we subjectively hand-labelled 70 occupations, assigning 1 if automatable, and 0 if not." (p. 30)

> Objective variables: "Second, we use objective O*NET variables corresponding to the defined bottlenecks to computerisation." (p. 30)

## 3. Methods/Data/Figures/Insights

### Data Collection and Processing

- [occupational_sample] Occupational Sample: Analyzes 702 detailed occupations from O*NET database

> Sample size: "Doing so, we end up with a final dataset consisting of 702 occupations." (p. 29)

> Employment coverage: "US employment for the 702 occupations we considered is 138.44 million. Hence our analysis excluded 4.628 million jobs, equivalent to 3 percent of total employment." (p. 29)

- [variable_selection] Variable Selection: Uses 9 O*NET variables measuring automation bottlenecks

> Variable source: "As reported in Table I, we identified nine variables that describe these attributes. These variables were derived from the O*NET survey, where the respondents are given multiple scales, with 'importance' and 'level' as the predominant pair." (p. 30)

### Classification Algorithm Performance

- [model_validation] Model Validation: Tests multiple classification approaches with cross-validation

> Best model: "The exponentiated quadratic model returns (narrowly) the best performance of the three (clearly outperforming the linear model corresponding to logistic regression), and was hence selected for the remainder of our testing." (p. 33)

> Accuracy score: "Note that its AUC score of nearly 0.9 represents accurate classification: our algorithm successfully managed to reproduce our hand-labels specifying whether an occupation was computerisable." (p. 33)

### Key Findings and Distribution

- [risk_distribution] Employment Risk Distribution: 47% high-risk, 19% medium-risk, 33% low-risk

> High risk share: "According to our estimate, 47 percent of total US employment is in the high risk category, meaning that associated occupations are potentially automatable over some unspecified number of years, perhaps a decade or two." (p. 37)

- [wave_pattern] Two-Wave Pattern: Predicts immediate automation followed by technological plateau

> Wave pattern: "Our findings suggest that recent developments in ML will put a substantial share of employment, across a wide range of occupations, at risk in the near future. According to our estimates, however, this wave of automation will be followed by a subsequent slowdown in computers for labour substitution, due to persisting inhibiting engineering bottlenecks to computerisation." (p. 38)

### Wage and Education Correlations

- [negative_correlation] Negative Correlation: Strong inverse relationship between wages/education and automation risk

> Correlation finding: "Figure IV reveals that both wages and educational attainment exhibit a strong negative relationship with the probability of computerisation." (p. 41)

> Polarization break: "Rather than reducing the demand for middle-income occupations, which has been the pattern over the past decades, our model predicts that computerisation will mainly substitute for low-skill and low-wage jobs in the near future." (p. 41)

### Specific Technological Examples

- [healthcare_automation] Healthcare Automation: IBM Watson and diagnostic automation

> Watson example: "Oncologists at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center are, for example, using IBM's Watson computer to provide chronic care and cancer treatment diagnostics. Knowledge from 600,000 medical evidence reports, 1.5 million patient records and clinical trials, and two million pages of text from medical journals, are used for benchmarking and pattern recognition purposes." (p. 17)

- [transportation_automation] Transportation Automation: Google's driverless cars and logistics

> Driverless cars: "The autonomous driverless cars, developed by Google, provide one example of how manual tasks in transport and logistics may soon be automated." (p. 3)

> Navigation solution: "It is now completely feasible to store representations of the entire road network on-board a car, dramatically simplifying the navigation problem." (p. 20)

- [robotics_examples] Robotics Examples: Baxter robot and industrial automation

> Baxter robot: "Baxter, a 22,000 USD general-purpose robot, provides a well-known example. The robot features an LCD display screen displaying a pair of eyes that take on different expressions depending on the situation." (p. 21)

> Cost decline: "Over the past decades, robot prices have fallen about 10 percent annually and are expected to decline at an even faster pace in the near future (MGI, 2013)." (p. 21)

- [service_automation] Service Automation: Call centers and education

> Call center automation: "Moreover, a company called SmartAction now provides call computerisation solutions that use ML technology and advanced speech recognition to improve upon conventional interactive voice response systems, realising cost savings of 60 to 80 percent over an outsourced call center consisting of human labour (CAA, 2012)." (p. 18)

> Education automation: "Even education, one of the most labour intensive sectors, will most likely be significantly impacted by improved user interfaces and algorithms building upon big data." (p. 18)

### Comparative Advantages of Computers

- [scalability_advantage] Scalability Advantage: Computers can handle large-scale computations better than humans

> Scalability: "The use of big data is afforded by one of the chief comparative advantages of computers relative to human labor: scalability. Little evidence is required to demonstrate that, in performing the task of laborious computation, networks of machines scale better than human labour (Campbell-Kelly, 2009)." (p. 16)

- [bias_advantage] Lack of Human Biases: Algorithms can make impartial decisions without human constraints

> Bias advantage: "Computerisation of cognitive tasks is also aided by another core comparative advantage of algorithms: their absence of some human biases. An algorithm can be designed to ruthlessly satisfy the small range of tasks it is given." (p. 16)

> Judicial bias example: "Consider an example of human bias: Danziger, et al. (2011) demonstrate that experienced Israeli judges are substantially more generous in their rulings following a lunch break." (p. 16)

### Task Simplification Strategies

- [prefabrication_example] Prefabrication in Construction: How task restructuring enables automation

> Construction automation: "Prefabrication, in which the construction object is partially assembled in a factory before being transported to the construction site, provides a way of largely removing the requirement for adaptability. It allows many construction tasks to be performed by robots under controlled conditions that eliminate task variability." (p. 25)

- [warehouse_navigation] Warehouse Navigation: Kiva Systems example of clever task design

> Navigation solution: "Perception problems can, however, sometimes be sidestepped by clever task design. For example, Kiva Systems, acquired by Amazon.com in 2012, solved the problem of warehouse navigation by simply placing bar-code stickers on the floor, informing robots of their precise location (Guizzo, 2008)." (p. 24)

### Specific Occupation Examples

- [high_risk_occupations] High-Risk Occupations: Examples of jobs most likely to be automated

> Sales occupations: "High risk sales occupations include, for example, cashiers, counter and rental clerks, and telemarketers. Although these occupations involve interactive tasks, they do not necessarily require a high degree of social intelligence." (p. 38)

> Legal automation: "For example, we find that paralegals and legal assistants – for which computers already substitute – in the high risk category. At the same time, lawyers, which rely on labour input from legal assistants, are in the low risk category." (p. 41)

- [low_risk_occupations] Low-Risk Occupations: Examples of jobs requiring creativity and social intelligence

> Chief executives: "As a prototypical example of generalist work requiring a high degree of social intelligence, consider the O*NET tasks reported for chief executives, involving 'conferring with board members, organization officials, or staff members to discuss issues, coordinate activities, or resolve problems', and 'negotiating or approving contracts or agreements.'" (p. 40)

> Actors: "The O*NET tasks of actors, for example, involve 'performing humorous and serious interpretations of emotions, actions, and situations, using body movements, facial expressions, and gestures', and 'learning about characters in scripts and their relationships to each other in order to develop role interpretations.'" (p. 40)

## 4. Conclusions/Limitations

### Conclusions

- [high_risk] High Automation Risk: Nearly half of US employment potentially automatable

> Risk estimate: "According to our estimates around 47 percent of total US employment is in the high risk category. We refer to these as jobs at risk – i.e. jobs we expect could be automated relatively soon, perhaps over the next decade or two." (p. 43)

- [vulnerable_sectors] Vulnerable Sectors: Transportation, logistics, office support, production, and services most at risk

> Transportation risk: "Our model predicts that most workers in transportation and logistics occupations, together with the bulk of office and administrative support workers, and labour in production occupations, are at risk." (p. 43)

> Service surprise: "More surprisingly, we find that a substantial share of employment in service occupations, where most US job growth has occurred over the past decades (Autor and Dorn, 2013), are highly susceptible to computerisation." (p. 44)

- [protected_occupations] Protected Occupations: Creative and social intelligence tasks least vulnerable

> Skill requirement: "Our findings thus imply that as technology races ahead, low-skill workers will reallocate to tasks that are non-susceptible to computerisation – i.e., tasks requiring creative and social intelligence." (p. 44)

### Limitations

- [no_timeline] No Timeline Predictions: Avoids specific timeframes for automation

> Timeline avoidance: "We make no attempt to estimate the number of jobs that will actually be automated." (p. 42)

> Bottleneck uncertainty: "We avoid making any predictions about the number of years it may take to overcome various engineering bottlenecks to computerisation." (p. 43)

- [economic_factors] Economic Factors Not Considered: Labor costs, capital prices, and regulatory factors excluded

> Economic factors: "We do not account for future wage levels, capital prices or labour shortages." (p. 42)

> Regulatory factors: "Regulatory concerns and political activism may slow down the process of computerisation." (p. 42)

- [within_occupation] Within-Occupation Variation: Focuses on full automation rather than partial task automation

> Full automation focus: "Since our probability estimates describe the likelihood of an occupation being fully automated, we do not capture any within-occupation variation resulting from the computerisation of tasks that simply free-up time for human labour to perform other tasks." (p. 43)

### Caveats

- [tech_uncertainty] Technological Uncertainty: Difficulty predicting technological progress

> Prediction difficulty: "Making predictions about technological progress is notoriously difficult (Armstrong and Sotala, 2012)." (p. 43)

- [historical_discontinuity] Historical Discontinuity: Suggests break from 20th century polarization pattern

> Century comparison: "We note that this finding implies a discontinuity between the nineteenth, twentieth and the twenty-first century, in the impact of capital deepening on the relative demand for skilled labour." (p. 44)

- [policy_implications] Policy Implications: Suggests need for creative and social skill development

> Skill development: "For workers to win the race, however, they will have to acquire creative and social skills." (p. 44)
