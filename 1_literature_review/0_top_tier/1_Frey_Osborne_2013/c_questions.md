# -------------------- IN DETAIL ------------------

### A. Methodological Questions

**[1_measurement]** What is our framework for understanding and measuring the impact of automation beyond simple job displacement, are there other methods we can use? Directly addressed and a key contribution.

- **Task-Based Analysis Framework**: The study develops a comprehensive framework that goes beyond simple job displacement by analyzing specific tasks within occupations

> "We implement a novel methodology to estimate the probability of computerisation for 702 detailed occupations, using a Gaussian process classifier." (p. 1)

> "To our knowledge, no study has yet quantified what recent technological progress is likely to mean for the future of employment. The present study intends to bridge this gap in the literature." (p. 3)

- **Engineering Bottlenecks Framework**: Identifies three key bottlenecks that prevent automation through systematic analysis

> "The bottlenecks to computerisation are thus: (a) perception and manipulation tasks, (b) creative intelligence tasks, and (c) social intelligence tasks." (p. 7)

> "For workers to win the race, however, they will have to acquire creative and social skills." (p. 44)

- **Machine Learning Classification Framework**: Uses Gaussian Process classifier trained on 70 hand-labeled occupations to predict automation probabilities

> "We tested three Gaussian process classifiers using the GPML toolbox (Rasmussen and Nickisch, 2010) on our data, built around exponentiated quadratic, rational quadratic and linear covariances." (p. 33)

> "The exponentiated quadratic model returns (narrowly) the best performance of the three (clearly outperforming the linear model corresponding to logistic regression), and was hence selected for the remainder of our testing." (p. 33)

- **Probability-Based Measurement**: Uses machine learning to assign automation probabilities rather than binary yes/no predictions

> "We make no attempt to estimate how many jobs will actually be automated. The actual extent and pace of computerisation will depend on several additional factors which were left unaccounted for." (p. 41)

2. [2_sources_and_metrics] What data sources and metrics are most 
reliable for tracking automation's effects on inequality? Directly 
addressed.

- **O*NET Occupational Database**: Uses detailed occupational task data as primary source

> "We rely on the 2010 version of the DOT successor ONET – an online service developed for the US Department of Labor." (p. 4)

> "Accordingly, ONET has the advantage of providing more recent information on occupational work activities." (p. 4)

- **Bureau of Labor Statistics Employment Data**: Integrates employment statistics for comprehensive analysis

> "Employment data is taken from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) 2010 Current Population Survey." (p. 4)

- **Machine Learning Training Process**: Trained using Gaussian Process classifier using 9 key O*NET variables on 70 hand-labeled occupations, then applied to all 702 occupations

> "Together with a group of ML researchers, we subjectively hand-labelled 70 occupations, assigning 1 if automatable, and 0 if not." (p. 30)

> "As reported in Table I, we identified nine variables that describe these attributes. These variables were derived from the O*NET survey, where the respondents are given multiple scales, with "importance" and "level" as the predominant pair." (p. 30)

> "Having validated our approach, we proceed to use classification to predict the probability of computerisation for all 702 occupations." (p. 34)

- **Wage and Education Metrics**: Incorporates economic inequality measures directly into analysis

> "Finally, we provide evidence that wages and educational attainment exhibit a strong negative relationship with the probability of computerisation." (p. 41)

### B. Economic Questions

**[3_automatable]** Which jobs, tasks and skills are most vulnerable to automation in the next 5 years, and what will remain valuable? Directly addressed - this is the paper's primary focus:

> "According to our estimates around 47 percent of total US employment is in the high risk category." (p. 43)

> "Our model predicts that most workers in transportation and logistics occupations, together with the bulk of office and administrative support workers, and labour in production occupations, are at risk." (p. 43)

> "More surprisingly, we find that a substantial share of employment in service occupations, where most US job growth has occurred over the past decades (Autor and Dorn, 2013), are highly susceptible to computerisation." (p. 44)

> Protected skills identified:

> "For workers to win the race, however, they will have to acquire creative and social skills." (p. 44)

> "Our findings thus imply that as technology races ahead, low-skill workers will reallocate to tasks that are non-susceptible to computerisation – i.e., tasks requiring creative and social intelligence." (p. 44)

**[4_big_tech]** What role do large tech companies and key automation players have in shaping the economic landscape and competition, including in the diffusion of technologies and methods? Mentioned but not deeply analyzed.

> "The autonomous driverless cars, developed by Google, provide one example of how manual tasks in transport and logistics may soon be automated." (p. 3)

> "In the section "In Domain After Domain, Computers Race Ahead", they emphasise how fast moving these developments have been." (p. 3)

**[5_SME_bureacrats]** How are small-to-medium enterprises and bureacratic institutions like governments affected, can they adapt to the wave of automation? Not addressed - The paper doesn't differentiate between business sizes or employment types.

### C. Societal Questions

**[6_inequality]** Is income and wealth inequality across different sectors and regions affected? Directly addressed with strong evidence. The paper shows that automation will exacerbate income inequality by targeting low-wage, low-skill jobs while protecting high-wage, high-education occupations.

> "Finally, we provide evidence that wages and educational attainment exhibit a strong negative relationship with the probability of computerisation." (p. 41)

> "Our model predicts a truncation in the current trend towards labour market polarisation, with computerisation being principally confined to low-skill and low-wage occupations." (p. 44)

> "We note that this finding implies a discontinuity between the nineteenth, twentieth and the twenty-first century, in the impact of capital deepening on the relative demand for skilled labour." (p. 44)

**[7_job_quality]** How is job quality and worker satisfaction affected, not just employment numbers? Not directly addressed - the paper focuses on job displacement rather than quality of remaining jobs.  

**[8_demographics]** Do different geographic regions and demographic groups (education, location, age, gender, ethnicity, immigration) experience automation differently? Partially addressed through education lens. The limitation is the paper doesn't directly address age or geographic differences, focusing primarily on educational attainment as a demographic factor.

> "We do the same for skill level, measured by the fraction of workers having obtained a bachelor's degree, or higher educational attainment, within each occupation." (p. 41)

> "Bachelor's degree or better Probability of Computerisation 0 0.5 1 0% 20% 40% 60%" (p. 41, Figure IV)

**[9_mitigation]** What policies and interventions could be most effective at mitigating the negative impacts of automation? Not directly addressed - The paper focuses on technological capabilities rather than policy solutions. However, it does mention:

> "Second, regulatory concerns and political activism may slow down the process of computerisation." (p. 42)

> "The states of California and Nevada are, for example, currently in the process of making legislatory changes to allow for driverless cars." (p. 42)

**[10_societal]** What are the environmental, psychological and social costs of automation that aren't captured in traditional economic metrics? Not addressed - The paper focuses purely on employment and economic metrics, not environmental or broader social impacts.
