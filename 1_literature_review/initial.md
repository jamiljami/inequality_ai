## PROMPT
- "What do other institutions, universities, labs and others say about the impact of AI and automation? What is currently being automated and in what mediums and domains, what is on the cusp or the frontier or in the next 5 years about to be automatable, what does the landscape look like in terms of who are the big players and businesses and tools." Is there anything I am missing from my research prompt?

## EXTRA
1. Temporal and Geographic Dimensions
- Historical context: How does current AI automation compare to previous automation waves (Industrial Revolution, computerization)?
- Geographic scope: You mention "in the west, outside west" but could be more specific about regional differences in adoption rates and impacts
- Timeline specificity: "Next 5 years" is good, but consider also 10-15 year horizons for longer-term planning
2. Policy and Regulatory Landscape
Current regulations: What policies exist around AI deployment in different sectors?
Proposed legislation: What new laws are being considered (AI Act, etc.)?
International coordination: How do different countries' approaches differ?
Industry self-regulation: What voluntary standards are emerging?
3. Social and Psychological Dimensions
Public perception: How do different demographic groups view AI automation?
Worker psychology: How does automation affect job satisfaction, stress, and mental health?
Social cohesion: Impact on community structures and social networks
Education and training: How are institutions adapting curricula for the AI era?
4. Infrastructure and Technical Considerations
Digital divide: Access to AI tools and high-speed internet
Energy requirements: Environmental impact of AI compute needs
Cybersecurity: Risks and vulnerabilities in automated systems
Data privacy: How automation affects personal data collection and use
5. Economic Modeling Gaps
Supply chain effects: How automation in one sector affects others
Consumer behavior changes: How automation affects purchasing patterns
Investment patterns: Where capital is flowing in response to automation
Tax implications: How automation affects government revenue and fiscal policy
6. Ethical and Governance Questions
Bias and fairness: How do automated systems perpetuate or reduce existing inequalities?
Accountability: Who is responsible when automated systems fail?
Transparency: How explainable are AI decisions in different domains?
Human oversight: What level of human control should be maintained?
7. Resilience and Adaptation
Retraining programs: What works and what doesn't for displaced workers?
Economic safety nets: How robust are current systems for handling automation shocks?
Alternative work models: Universal Basic Income, shorter work weeks, etc.
Community resilience: How do local economies adapt to automation?
8. Cross-Sector Analysis
Healthcare: Automation in diagnosis, treatment, and patient care
Education: AI tutors, automated grading, personalized learning
Transportation: Beyond self-driving cars to logistics and public transit
Finance: Algorithmic trading, automated lending, fraud detection
Creative industries: AI in art, music, writing, design
9. Measurement and Metrics
Productivity metrics: How to measure real productivity gains vs. job displacement
Quality of life indicators: Beyond GDP to happiness, health, social connection
Inequality measures: Gini coefficient, wealth distribution, access to opportunities
Environmental metrics: Carbon footprint, resource usage
10. Scenario Planning
Best-case scenarios: How automation could improve human welfare
Worst-case scenarios: Potential negative outcomes and mitigation strategies
Uncertainty factors: What we don't know and how to plan for it
Tipping points: When automation reaches critical mass in different sectors
