# Research Paper

## Overview
This document outlines the methodology for studying the impact of automation on industry, employment and economic disparity.

## Literature Review            [1_literature_review/]
1. What do other institutions, universities, labs and other say about the impact of AI on automation?
2. What is currently being automated and in what mediums and domains?
3. What is on the cusp or frontier or in the next 5 years about to be automated?
4. What does the landscape look like in terms of who are the big players and businesses and tools?
5. What are the effects on businesses, wealth inequality and society? We will stay at Level 3 [initial.md]. We will not consider the scope going wider in levels 4-5 (wide.md) or narrower in levels 2-3 (narrow.md).

### A. Primary Questions
1. [1_income_inequality] How does AI automation affect income inequality across different sectors and regions?
2. [2_jobs_and_skills] Which jobs are most vulnerable to automation in the next 5 years, and what skills will remain valuable?
3. [3_demographics] How do different demographic groups (age, education, location) experience automation differently?
4. [4_mitigation_policies] What policies and interventions are most effective at mitigating negative automation impacts?
### B. Secondary Questions
5. [5_job_quality] How does automation affect job quality and worker satisfaction, not just employment numbers?
6. [6_big_tech] What role do large tech companies play in shaping automation outcomes and economic inequality?
7. [7_losers] How do small businesses and gig workers adapt to automation compared to large corporations?
8. [8_environmental_social] What are the environmental and social costs of automation that aren't captured in economic metrics?
### C. Methodological Questions
9. [9_measuring_automation] How can we measure the true economic impact of automation beyond simple job displacement?
10. [10_sources_and_metrics] What data sources and metrics are most reliable for tracking automation's effects on inequality?
