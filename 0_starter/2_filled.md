# Research Paper

## Overview
This document outlines the methodology for studying the impact of automation on industry, employment and economic disparity.

## Literature Review            [1_literature_review/]
1. What do other institutions, universities, labs and other say about the impact of AI on automation?
2. What is currently being automated and in what mediums and domains?
3. What is on the cusp or frontier or in the next 5 years about to be automated?
4. What does the landscape look like in terms of who are the big players and businesses and tools?
5. What are the effects on businesses, wealth inequality and society? We will stay at Level 3 [initial.md]. We will not consider the scope going wider in levels 4-5 (wide.md) or narrower in levels 2-3 (narrow.md).

### A. Methodological Questions
1. [1_measurement] How can we measure the true economic impact of automation beyond simple job displacement?
2. [2_sources_and_metrics] What data sources and metrics are most reliable for tracking automation's effects on inequality?
### B. Economic Questions
3. [3_automatable] Which jobs, tasks and skills are most vulnerable to automation in the next 5 years, and what will remain valuable?
4. [6_big_tech] What role do large tech companies and key automation players have in shaping the economic landscape and competition?
5. [7_SME_bureacrats] How are small-to-medium enterprises and bureacratic institutions (like governments) affected, can they adapt to the wave of automation?
### C. Societal Questions
6. [6_inequality] Is income and wealth inequality across different sectors and regions affected?
7. [7_job_quality] How is job quality and worker satisfaction affected, not just employment numbers?
8. [8_demographics] Do different demographic groups (education, location, age, gender, ethnicity, immigration) experience automation differently?
9. [9_mitigation] What policies and interventions could be most effective at mitigating the negative impacts of automation?
10. [8_environmental_social] What are the environmental and social costs of automation that aren't captured in economic metrics?
