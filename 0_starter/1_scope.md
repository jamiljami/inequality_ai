# Simple Starter Doc & TODOs

## 1. [1_literature_review/] What do other sources say? 
- research of everything below. 
- [X] LIT REVIEW PROMPT: "What do other institutions, universities, labs and others say about the impact of AI and automation? What is currently being automated and in what mediums and domains, what is on the cusp or the frontier or in the next 5 years about to be automatable, what does the landscape look like in terms of who are the big players and businesses and tools."
- [O] SOURCE LIST ADD: Ask to do a research sweep

- [ ] SOURCE LIST REVIEW: 
	- Sort through source list with possible research questions refactor:
	- "I want to begin sorting through my sources. Which research questions in 2_filled.md do my first 5 sources in source_list touch upon? What does each of my first 5 sources say in terms of points 2-4 in 1_scope.md (automatable, effects, experiments)? Can you do it by listing the source first (going one by one), then appending the questions and details to it?"

## 2. [2_automatable/] What is currently automatable? 
- (image/video, text, code, digital, physical)
- who are the big players (in west, outside west)
- what is on the cusp or frontier of just being automated

## 3. [3_effects/] What are the current effects? 
- (business competition, business boosts + errors, empowered workers vs lost labour, unemployed social effects)

## 4. [4_experiments/] What is a thought experiment demonstration of an automated workplace? 
- Cashiers at a supermarket
- Self serve machine at fast food
- Automated port (hard)
- Self driving taxis
- Automated programming
- Consider:
	- Business operation costs VS revenues (BEFORE+AFTER automation)
	- Business competition effects
	- Employment effects
	- Customer effects

## 5. [5_conclusions/] What can we conclude from all of this?
- Speed of progress
- Effects on businesses and competition
- Effects on employment and markets
- Possible granular research e.g. simulation of an organisation, simulation of person, simulation of a market/industry

## 6. Clean up tasks
- 
- SUBFOLDERS: Possible to have all files together or separate by research question or use the subfolder structure:
	- data/ 		- datasets and raw data
	- notebooks/ 	- experiments
	- scripts/ 		- data collection and processing
	- docs/ 		- detailed documentation 
- README.md: Update badges with actual GitHub URLs, create contribution templates for issues and PRs
