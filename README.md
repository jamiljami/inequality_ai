# Understanding the impact of automation on human labour

A model-driven analysis on the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on human employment, economic inequality, and interaction as a whole.

## Research Focus Areas

- **Scope**: Constraining the complexity and granularity of our research. Developing an understanding of the levels which should be considerd in this study e.g. all humans, a nation, a network of humans (a business, organisation, family or socioeconomic group, etc), a single human; as well as automated or hyrbid equivalents. In addition to considering the complexity of analysis as explored below.
- **Framework**: Taking a first-principles and engineering-based approach to model tasks and agents to understand competition between humans and automated systems for digital and physical tasks.
    - Singleton Model: Agent Entity, Interaction Matrix, 
    - Graphical Model: Agent Nodes, Hierarchical Groupings, Token-based Connections
    - Many others

- **Human Agents**: Modelling how humans can be considered agents in the real world with simplifications.
- **AI Agents**:
- **World Model**: Mimicking the structure of the real world for our world models with simplications.
- **Task Frontier Catalogue**: Listing the exhaustive set of current human tasks plus future possible tasks with simplications.

- **Interaction Architecture**: Understanding how humans interact with one another on a large scale.

- **Token Generation Competition Model**: Understanding how automated systems will both empower humans to compete with one other (intracompetition) as well as compete directly against humans (intercompetition)


- **Minimum Assist Scenario**:
    - **Job Displacement Analysis**: Studying which jobs are most vulnerable to AI automation
    - **Skill Gap Assessment**: Analyzing the skills humans need to remain competitive
    - **Economic Impact Modeling**: Understanding AI's effect on income distribution
    - **Policy Recommendations**: Developing strategies for equitable AI adoption
