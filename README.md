# Understanding the impact of automation on human labour

A model-driven analysis on the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on human employment, economic inequality, and interaction as a whole.

## Ethos
- Agree on current societal groups:
    - The Vulnerable: low-cash-reserve holders, below-median-wage earners, welfare, the homeless, the sick
    - The Stable: medium-reserve holders, above-median-wage earners, low asset owners, small-medium businesses
    - The Wealthy: high-reserve holders, medium-high asset owners, large businesses
    - // Add in non-western nations and individuals
- To minimize harm to the Vulnerable:
    - the individual especially those on the poorer end of the scale
    - the vulnerable in society who lack means to maintain themselves
    - those who do not own assets
    - the businesses and workers who cannot compete with rapid adaptation
    - public systems which maintain services and infrastructure
- To consider the Stable and the Wealthy:
    - those who have money and assets to not become disaffected
    - the worker who strives to earn a living

## Broad Questions (draft)
We frame questions in a negative-first way to ensure we consider the vulnerable while focusing on industrial questions as related to automation. 
- // Could group into People-Centric vs Industry-Centric vs Gov-Centric vs International-Centric

1. Does automation change survival for workers?
- Business Private:
    - Is it easy to get away with replacing labour?
    - Is labour just replaced for the same output or do we actually increase output without replacing labour?
- Workers Public:
    - Do we make labour more difficult with more competition, removed jobs and lower wages, or do we make more jobs with better pay?
    - Are the lives of the working class, poor or sick made worse, or do we benefit them?

2. Does automation change survival for businesses? 
    - make business harder? E.g monopoly/oligopoly
    - Do markets turn into monopolies/oligopolies or do we ensure fairer competition and small-medium business survival?

3. Does automation affect the environment?
    - Does the environment, atmospheres and oceans suffer more damage?

4. Bad Scenario Checks
- Economics
    - Does labour lose out (who specifically)?
    - Does it damage social protection systems?
    - Do electricity costs increase?
- Social
    - Do services perform worse or become ineffectual?
    - Do people become less trusting of each other?
    - Do people become overwhelmed or distracted?
    - Do relationships, marriages and birth rate decrease?
- Environmental
    - Does it increase carbon emissions, toxic/heavy metal emissions, landscape degradation?
- Political
    - Does it increase chance of war?
    - Does it increase hegemony?

## Research Focus Areas

- **Scope & Framework**: Developing multi-level models (individual to societal) using first-principles and engineering approaches to analyze human-AI competition across digital and physical tasks

- **Agent Modeling**: 
  - Studying how humans and AI agents interact and compete in various contexts
  - Analyzing network effects and emergent behaviors in multi-agent systems
  - Modeling skill development and adaptation over time

- **Task Analysis**:
  - Cataloging current human tasks and projected future capabilities
  - Mapping the expanding frontier of automation
  - Identifying areas of human competitive advantage

- **Interaction Architecture**:
  - Understanding human-human and human-AI interaction patterns
  - Modeling competition and collaboration scenarios
  - Analyzing information and resource flows

- **Economic Impact**:
  - Modeling effects on income distribution and inequality
  - Analyzing market dynamics and equilibrium states
  - Studying policy interventions and outcomes

- **Vulnerability Scenario**:
    - **Job Displacement Analysis**: Studying which jobs are most vulnerable to AI and automation
    - **Skill Gap Assessment**: Analyzing the skills humans need to remain 
    competitive
    - **Economic Impact Modeling**: Understanding AI's effect on income distribution
    - **Policy Recommendations**: Developing strategies for equitable AI adoption

We employ multiple modeling approaches including agent-based models, economic models, network analysis, and machine learning to develop comprehensive insights.
