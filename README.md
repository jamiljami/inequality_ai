# Understanding the Impact of AI and Automation on Human Labour 🤖

> A model-driven analysis on the impact of automated and generative systems on human employment and economic inequality, and wider implications in society as a whole.

---

## 🎯 Ethos

Our goals are aligned with understanding how AI automation affects different economic groups with:

- **🛡️ Primary Focus** on protecting vulnerable populations including low-income workers, small businesses and public services from automation's negative impacts
- **⚖️ Balanced Approach** considering effects across all economic strata while prioritizing those most at risk  
- **🌍 Global Perspective** examining both developed and developing nation contexts

---

## 💡 Research Focus Areas

Research questions are framed in a negative-first way to ensure consideration for the most vulnerable while addressing our scope. We examine automation's effects through multiple lenses:

### 🔍 Research Scope
- 📈 Current automation trends and adoption patterns
- 💰 Economic, social, and policy impacts 
- 🏥 Cross-sector analysis (healthcare, education, transportation, finance)
- 🔧 Infrastructure and technical considerations
- ⚖️ Ethical and governance implications

### 📊 Analysis Dimensions
- **👥 People-Centric:** How automation affects workers, families, and communities
- **🏢 Industry-Centric:** Business adaptation and competitive dynamics  
- **🏛️ Government-Centric:** Policy responses and public service impacts
- **🌐 International-Centric:** Global trade, migration, and development patterns
